## Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze weather data for the months of June and December from multiple weather stations in Hawaii in hopes of informing our business partner whether opening our surf & ice cream store on Oahu is a sustainable year-round business venture. 

## Results
June Temperature Summary Statistics vs. December Temperature Summary Statistics:

### Observations About Temperature Summaries
- The maximum high temperature in June is only 2 degrees higher than in December
- There is only a ~4 degree difference in the average monthly temperature between June and December
- There is an 8 degree difference in the monthly minimum temperature between June and December

## Summary
Overall, the temperature patterns on Oahu in June and December are remarkably similar, with only several degrees of separation between the averages.

Additionally, while knowing the temperature summaries helps inform our business partner on overall weather trends on Oahu, it would also be helpful to have grouped ranges of observed temperatures to show whether the temperatures typically fall above or below the mean temperature for each respective month.

December Temperature Distribution:

We can see that whether it is summer (June) or winter (December) on Oahu, the majority of temperature observations fall close to the mean temperature with very few (if any) outliers. This realization bodes well for the proposed surf & ice cream store.
