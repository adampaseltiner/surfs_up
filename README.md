## Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze weather data for the months of June and December from multiple weather stations in Hawaii in hopes of informing our business partner of the best location to open our surf & ice cream store. 

## Results
June Temperature Summary Statistics vs. December Temperature Summary Statistics:

### Observations About Temperature Summaries
- The maximum high temperature in June is only 2 degrees higher than in December
- There is only a ~4 degree difference in the average monthly temperature between June and December
- There is an 8 degree difference in the monthly minimum temperature between June and December

## Summary
While having the knowledge of statistics on temperature averages helps inform our business partner on weather trends in Hawaii, it would also be helpful to know:
- The total number of days that temperatures typically fall above or below the average temperatue measurement
- The average precipitation amounts by month and how they correlate to ideal weather conditions for opening our new business
